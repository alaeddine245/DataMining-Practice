# DataMining-Practice
INSAT's Data Mining Coursework:
- Applying two classification algorithms (NaiveBayes and Decision Tree) on the IRIS Dataset
- Implementing the train_test_split function from scratch
- Applying multiple clustering algorithms on the cheese dataset (kmeans and cah)
- Implementing the DIANA clustering algorithm ( with KMeans(k=2) for each step)
